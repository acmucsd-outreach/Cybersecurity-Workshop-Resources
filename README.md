# Cybersecurity-Workshop-Resources
This workshop is an introductory level workshop covering a breadth of topics with interactive challenges involving the basics of cybersecurity. Explore the field with lessons and activities covering cryptography, digital forensics, and general cyber skills. For this workshop we will utilize [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org) which provides capture-the-flag challenges to introduce cybsersecuirty skills. Below is a list of the picoCTF challenges and additional resources that will be used throughout the workshop.
## Cryptography
The cryptography section will introduce hashing, encryption, and signing.
<ul>
  <li> Hashing
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/475">hashcrack</a>. To solve this hashing related challenge, we will use <a href="https://crackstation.net/">crackstation.net</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Encryption
    <ol>
      <li>The first picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/62">13</a>. To solve this caesar shift cypher related challenge, we will use <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher">decode.fr</a>.</li>
      <li>The second picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/470">Even RSA Can Be Broken???</a>. To solve solve this encryption related challenge, we will need to look at the code provided by picoCTF which can be more easily viewed <a href="https://github.com/acmucsd-outreach/Cybersecurity-Workshop-Resources/blob/main/picoCTF-challenges/Even-RSA-Can-Be-Broken/encrypt.py">here</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Signing
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/236">JAuth</a>. To solve this JWT related challenge, we will use <a href="https://token.dev/">token.dev</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
