# Cybersecurity-Workshop-Resources
This workshop is an introductory level workshop covering a breadth of topics with interactive challenges involving the basics of cybersecurity. Explore the field with lessons and activities covering cryptography, digital forensics, and general cyber skills. For this workshop we will utilize [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org) which provides capture-the-flag challenges to introduce cybsersecuirty skills. Below is a list of the picoCTF challenges and additional resources that will be used throughout the workshop.
## General Cyber Skills
The general cyber skills section will introduce CTF style question as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">Netcat</a> utility
<ul>
  <li>Into Challenges
    <ol>
      <li>The first picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/147">Obedient Cat</a>. This challenge will help introduce the picoCTF interface.</li>
      <li>The second picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/320">First Find</a>. This challenge will involve working with finding hidden files.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Net Cat
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/34">what's a net cat</a>. This challenge will introduce the use of Netcat.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

## Cryptography
The cryptography section will introduce encryption and hashing.
<ul>
  <li> Encryption
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/62">13</a>. To solve this caesar shift cypher related challenge, we will use <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher">decode.fr</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Hashing
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/475">hashcrack</a>. To solve this hashing related challenge, we will use <a href="https://crackstation.net/">crackstation.net</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

## Digital Forensics
The digital forensics section will involve working with files
<ul>
  <li> File Inspection
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/423">Secret of the Polygot</a>. To solve this challenge we will observe how changing file types can be used to hide data.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Hidden Text
    <ol>
      <li>The picoCTF challenge we will use is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/44">Glory of the Garden</a>. To solve this challenge we will use <a href="https://hexed.it/">hexed.it</a> which allows us to view the raw data of a file.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
